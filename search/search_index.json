Genome assembly is the process of joining together DNA sequencing fragments into longer pieces, ideally up to chromosome lengths. The DNA fragments are produced by DNA sequencing machines, and are called \u201creads\u201d. These are in lengths of about 150 nucleotides (base pairs), to up to a million+ nucleotides, depending on the sequencing technology used. Currently, most reads are from Illumina (short), PacBio (long) or Oxford Nanopore (long and extra-long). It is difficult to assemble plant genomes as they are often large (for example, 3,000,000,000 base pairs), have many repeat regions (such as transposons), and may be polyploid. This tutorial shows genome assembly for a smaller data set - the plant chloroplast genome - a single circular chromosome about 160,000 base pairs long. What\u2019s in this tutorial? The chloroplast genome of the sweet potato has been sequenced. This has produced many sequencing reads - DNA fragments. We will try to join these reads together to make the whole chloroplast genome sequence. We will use the Galaxy Australia platform (a web page) to run our analysis. This tutorial assumes some familiarity with Galaxy and bioinformatics - if you are new to either of these, we recommend the Galaxy Australia Training tutorials Get started, Learn key tasks, Quality control, Genome assembly, and Genome annotation , as this chloroplast genome assembly tutorial is slightly more complicated. You can follow all the steps, or skip any optional steps: Get data \u2192 Read quality \u2192 Assemble\u2192 Polish \u2192 View reads \u2192 Annotate \u2192 Repeat with new data What\u2019s not in this tutorial? A full chloroplast data set: we are using a subset. A full explanation of all the steps involved and all the possible variations in the workflow; answers to some of the questions. A workflow to assemble and annotate the chloroplast genome of any plant species: in this tutorial some steps are manual, and tools and settings may not be optimal for other plant species. A workflow to assemble the nuclear genome of any plant species. The process shown here is generally applicable to assembling plant nuclear genomes but there would be extra steps (and much more time) involved. For example, additional sequencing would usually be run on 10X, BioNano or HiC to produce information to link up longer nuclear chromosome pieces and to separate out the maternal and paternal haplotypes. Get data Log in to Galaxy Australia and create a new history. The data is from this paper: Zhou C, Duarte T, Silvestre R et al. 2018 , hosted at EBI ENA.

Why might there be several annotations over the same genome region? Repeat with new data Optional. Skip this section for a quicker tutorial We can assemble another chloroplast genome using sequence data from a different plant species: the snow gum, Eucalyptus pauciflora . This data is from Wang W, Schalamun M, Morales-Suarez A et al. 2018 . The original FASTQ read files (Illumina - SRR7153063, Nanopore - SRR7153095) have been modified and reduced for this tutorial. Get the data: If ok with data authors, upload data subsets to zenodo and link here. Run Nanopolot on the nanopore reads. Use Flye to assemble the nanopore reads, then get Fasta statistics Note: this may take several hours. To see a completed assembly of this data now - go to XXX. Use Bandage to view the assembly graph. Note: Download the graphical fragment assembly file from Galaxy, not the assembly_graph file. Bandage needs to be installed on your computer. Use Pilon to polish the assembly with short Illumina reads. Note: Don\u2019t forget to map these Illumina reads to the assembly first using bwa-mem, then use the resulting bam file as input to Pilon. Annotate the genome using the GeSeq tool at Chlorobox . Note: First download the polished.fasta file, then upload at Chlorobox. Upload the annotations to Galaxy. Note: First download the gff3 file from Chlorobox, then upload to Galaxy. Use JBrowse to view the assembled, annotated genome.

See this workflow in Galaxy to do What\u2019s next? What can you do with an assembled genome? Common tasks are: Call (find) variants (SNPs) by comparing sequencing reads to the reference (the assembled genome). Find larger structural variants (SVs) by comparing multiple genomes. Use multiple genomes (or a set of genes within) for phylogenetic inference. Compare the genes found in one genome with another.
