# Phylogenomics

* The "Genomics for Australian Plants" project is working on the phylogenomics of Australian plant species. 
* Link to project details: [https://www.genomicsforaustralianplants.com/phylogenomics/](https://www.genomicsforaustralianplants.com/phylogenomics/)
* The project will likely use some aspects of the tool HybPiper: [https://github.com/mossmatters/HybPiper](https://github.com/mossmatters/HybPiper)
* A great set of tutorial material is available here: [https://github.com/mossmatters/KewHybSeqWorkshop](https://github.com/mossmatters/KewHybSeqWorkshop) including how to assemble contigs with HybPiper, alignment, and phylogenomics. 
* This is a clear description of using HypPiper in a computer cluster with Slurm commands:  [https://uribeconvers.wordpress.com/2017/04/24/377/](https://uribeconvers.wordpress.com/2017/04/24/377/)
