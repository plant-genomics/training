<h2 id="what-is-genome-assembly">What is genome assembly?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Genome assembly is the process of joining together DNA sequencing fragments into longer pieces, ideally up to chromosome lengths.</li>
<li>The DNA fragments are produced by DNA sequencing machines, and are called &ldquo;reads&rdquo;. These are in lengths of about 150 nucleotides (base pairs), to up to a million+ nucleotides, depending on the sequencing technology used. Currently, most reads are from Illumina (short), PacBio (long) or Oxford Nanopore (long and extra-long).</li>
<li>It is difficult to assemble plant genomes as they are often large (for example, 3,000,000,000 base pairs), have many repeat regions (such as transposons), and may be polyploid.</li>
<li>This tutorial shows genome assembly for a smaller data set - the plant chloroplast genome - a single circular chromosome about 160,000 base pairs long. <img alt="plant-genome" src="../images/plant-chromosomes.png" /></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whats-in-this-tutorial">What&rsquo;s in this tutorial?</h2>
<ul>
<li>The chloroplast genome of the sweet potato has been sequenced.</li>
<li>This has produced many sequencing reads - DNA fragments.</li>
<li>We will try to join these reads together to make the whole chloroplast genome sequence.</li>
<li>We will use the Galaxy Australia platform (a web page) to run our analysis.</li>
<li>This tutorial assumes some familiarity with Galaxy and bioinformatics - if you are new to either of these, we recommend the <a href="https://galaxy-au-training.github.io/tutorials/">Galaxy Australia Training</a> tutorials <em>Get started, Learn key tasks, Quality control, Genome assembly, </em>and<em> Genome annotation</em>, as this chloroplast genome assembly tutorial is slightly more complicated.</li>
<li>You can follow all the steps, or skip any <op>optional</op> steps:</li>
<li><st>Get data &rarr; <op>Read quality</op> &rarr; Assemble&rarr; Polish &rarr; <op>View reads</op> &rarr; <op>Annotate</op>  &rarr; <op>Repeat with new data</op></st></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whats-not-in-this-tutorial">What&rsquo;s <em>not</em> in this tutorial?</h2>
<ul>
<li>The best assembly of the sweet potato chloroplast data: here, we are using a data subset.</li>
<li>A full explanation of all the steps involved and all the possible variations in the workflow; answers to some of the questions.</li>
<li>A workflow to assemble and annotate the chloroplast genome of any plant species: in this tutorial some steps are manual, and tools and settings may not be optimal for other plant species.</li>
<li>A workflow to assemble the nuclear genome of any plant species. The process shown here is generally applicable to assembling plant nuclear genomes but there would be extra steps (and much more time) involved. For example, additional sequencing would usually be run on 10X, BioNano or HiC to produce information to link up longer nuclear chromosome pieces and to separate out the maternal and paternal haplotypes.</li>

<div class="admonition note">
<p>What summary statistics would be useful to look at?</p>
<details><summary>Click for answer</summary><p><br>
This will depend on the aim of your analysis, but usually:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Sequencing depth</strong> (the number of reads covering each base position; also called &ldquo;coverage&rdquo;). Higher depth is usually better, but at very high depths it may be better to subsample the reads, as errors can swamp the assembly graph.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sequencing quality</strong> (the quality score indicates probability of base call being correct). You may trim or filter reads on quality. Phred quality scores are logarithmic: phred quality 10 = 90% chance of base call being correct; phred quality 20 = 99% chance of base call being correct. More detail <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phred_quality_score">here</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Read lengths</strong> (read lengths histogram, and reads lengths vs. quality plots). Your analysis or assembly may need reads of a certain length.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</details>
</div>
<!--
sequencing depth
total bases, to work out depth (num of reads covering each base position)
e.g. total bases = 13 million
(total bases = num reads x av read length)

if genome size  = 160,000
then depth 13,000,000 / 160,000
depth = approx X80

<ul>
<li><op>Optional further steps:</op></li>
<li>Find out the quality of your reads using other tools such as fastp or FastQC. </li>
<li>To visualize base quality using emoji you can also use FASTQE :smile:</li>
<li>Run FASTQE for the illumina reads. In the output, look at the mean values (the middle row)</li>
<li>Repeat FASTQE for the nanopore reads. In the tool settings, increase the maximum read length to 30000.</li>

<!-- replace with the galaxy version when bug is fixed -->

<div class="admonition note">
<p>What is your interpretation of this assembly graph?</p>
<details><summary>Click for answer</summary><p><br>
One interpretation is that this represents the typical circular chloroplast structure: There is a long single-copy region (the node of around 78,000 bp), connected to the inverted repeat (a node of around 28,000 bp), connected to the short single-copy region (of around 11,000 bp). In the graph, each end loop is a single-copy region (either long or short) and the centre bar is the collapsed inverted repeat which should have about twice the sequencing depth.</p>

<div class="admonition note">
<p>How does the short-read Pilon-polished assembly compare to the unpolished <fn>flye-assembly.fasta</fn>?</p>
<details><summary>Click for answer</summary><p><br>
This will depend on the settings, but as an example: your polished assembly might be about 10-15 Kbp longer. Nanopore reads can have homopolymer deletions - a run of AAAA may be interpreted as AAA - so the more accurate illumina reads may correct these parts of the long-read assembly. In the <fn>Changes</fn> file, there may be a lot of cases showing a supposed deletion (represented by a dot) being corrected to a base. </p>
</details>
</div>
<ul>
<li><op>Optional further steps:</op></li>
<li>Run a second round (or more) of Pilon polishing. Keep track of file naming; you will need to generate a new bam file first before each round of Pilon.</li>
<li>Run an alternative polishing tool, such as Racon. This uses the long reads themselves to correct the long-read (Flye) assembly. It would be better to run this tool on the Flye assembly before running Pilon, rather than after Pilon. </li>

<ul>
<li>What can you do with an assembled genome? Common tasks are:</li>
<li>Call (find) variants (SNPs) by comparing sequencing reads to the reference (the assembled genome).</li>
<li>Find larger structural variants (SVs) by comparing multiple genomes.</li>
<li>Use multiple genomes (or a set of genes within) for phylogenetic inference.</li>
<li>Compare the genes found in one genome with another.</li>

<!-- File prep sweet potato data:

I've cut down the size of these datasets and hosted the data on Zenodo (with permission from author Lachlan Coin) at http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3567224

Created history: sweet potato chloroplast tutorial data

Nanopore data
Galaxy: Get data: EBI SRA:
enter in search box: SRR6828567
click on the link under run
under FASTQ files (Galaxy) click on File 1
will upload into current history

repeat for Illumina data: SRR6828568
note this data says paired but there is only one file.
these don't look paired, I uncompressed and looked at the last reads in the file and they are numbered xxx/1
probably ok to use though as just using for correction

Renamed.
Uncompressed (don't know what this tool is or how to find it in tools).
Reduced.
Very reduced (for a bam example).

the paper used slightly diff assembly method, which included correcting nanopore reads with illumina reads, trimming low qual, assembling nano with canu, then polish with pilon and illumina.

=> illumina file
I found this by ncbi - looking at the Tanzania sample (see paper supp table S1) that gave the nanopore file (which is easy to find bc only one nanopore file in the set, but lots of illumina) - then searched for all reads under under this, and found the accompanying illumina file.
